# Git Smart!

The intro text you see on the front of a Github respository is the repo's *README* file. This is often written in markdown, which looks like this ... 

    # Headline
    
    ## Subhead 
    
    Paragraph text (with a link to RollCall.com)[http://www.rollcall.com]
    
    _Some Bullets_
    
    * One
    * Two
    * Three 
    
Github knows what to do with these files, and automatically converts them to HTML to display on the site, which looks like this:

# Headline
    
## Subhead 
    
Paragraph text (with a link to RollCall.com)[http://www.rollcall.com]

_Some Bullets_

* One
* Two
* Three
