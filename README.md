# Git Smart!

The intro text you see on the front of a Github respository is the repo's *README* file. This is often written in markdown, which looks like this ... 

    # Headline
    
    #Subhead 
    
    Paragraph text
    
Github knows what to do with these files, and automatically converts them to HTML to display on the site.
